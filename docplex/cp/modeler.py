def pack(*args):

    The *pack* constraint is used to represent sub-problems where the requirement
    is to assign objects to containers such that the capacities or minimum fill levels of the containers are respected. 
    Let's assume we have *n* objects
    and *m* containers.  The sizes of the array arguments of *pack* must correspond
    to these constants.  That is, *load* must be of size *m*, whereas *where*
    and *size* must be of size *n*.
    Given assignments to the *where* expressions,
    the *pack* constraint will calculate the values of the *load* and *used*
    expressions.
    
    All counting is done from 0, and so
    the interpretation of 5 being assigned to *where[3]* is that object 3
    (the 4th object) is placed into container 5 (the 6th container). This will be
    reflected by the inclusion of the size of object 3 (*size[3]*) being
    included in the calculation of the value of *load[5]*.
    
    Naturally, all the arguments (with the exception of *size*) can
    be constrained by additional constraints.  The most common form is to limit
    the capacity of a container.  For example, to limit container 2
    to a capacity of 15, one would write *load[2] <= 15*.  Minimum fill level
    requirements can also be specified this way: for example *load[2] >= 12*.
    Other more esoteric constraints are possible, for example to say that only
    an even number of containers can be used: *(used % 2) == 0*.  If *used*
    is omitted from the signature, then it will not be possible to specifically
    constrain the number of containers used.

    Args:
